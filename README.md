# Node-Gallery
My personal project of a site, where you can upload and view images, using NodeJs, Express, Multer, and MongoDB.

Inspiration came from Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qzmri1WaaE)
and the layout idea from Rafaela Ferro (https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f).

This was my first attempt to make a working static node page, using templets, file uploading and using NoSQL database.
